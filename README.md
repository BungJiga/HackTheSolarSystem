# Hack The Solar System
Repository for AMNH's Fifth Annual BridgeUP: STEM Hackathon, Hack the Solar System!

The root directory of this repository contains data, documents, and images that are general purpose and could pertain to multiple challenges. Challenge specific data, documents, and images can be found under the challenges directory in a subdirectory with the same name as that challenge. Cloning this repository will give you local copies of all source and data files for all challenges that are not available on hard drives at the event (see organizers at the event for details).

Everyone attending Hack the Solar System must read, agree to, and sign the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/amnh/HackTheSolarSystem/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Don't forget to check social media for hashtag [#HackTheSolarSystem](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=hackthesolarsystem&src=typd) and tag your own posts with that hashtag!

See the [**wiki**](https://github.com/amnh/HackTheSolarSystem/wiki) for all the details! PLEASE NOTE: The wiki is still a work in progress, but we are working to supply you with all the challenge details and data we can give you prior to the event.

Hackathon project repositories will eventually appear on the [HackTheSolarSystem organization page](https://github.com/HackTheSolarSystem)
